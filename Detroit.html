                    <h1>About Detroit</h1>
                    <p>
                        Detroit is Michigan's largest city, renowned for its fascinating history and vibrant culture. In
                        1701, French explorer Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac founded the city, which
                        became the epicenter of the American automotive industry and home to giants like General Motors,
                        Ford, and Chrysler. The city's population peaked at 1.85 million in 1950
                        despite facing significant economic challenges, including becoming the largest U.S. city to file
                        for bankruptcy in 2013.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Culturally, Detroit has made substantial contributions. It is the birthplace of Motown Records,
                        which produced legends like Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye. The
                        city has also played a pivotal role in jazz, techno, and rock music. Iconic landmarks such as
                        the Renaissance Center and a bustling arts scene have earned Detroit the status
                        of a UNESCO "City of Design." Sports teams, music, and cultural festivals are the heart of the
                        city.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In recent years, Detroit has been undergoing a revitalization. Downtown and Midtown are vibrant,
                        with new developments, businesses, and restored historic sites.
                        Revitalization efforts have opened opportunities within the city, returning it to its former
                        status.
